# Project L2

This software program processes a .csv file containing either the voters' ballot, showcasing their preferences for each candidate in order, or a matrix detailing pairwise preferences. It employs various methods to determine the winner, including the Uninominal single-round race (as utilized in the UK and Commonwealth countries) and the Uninominal two-round race (as employed in France). Additionally, it incorporates the Condorcet Minimax and Condorcet Schulze methods, which aim to more accurately represent the voters' preferences, as highlighted by Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet, in his work "Essai sur l’application de l’analyse à la probabilité des décisions rendues à la pluralité des voix".

This project constitutes a component of my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, undertaken during the first semester of my second year.
